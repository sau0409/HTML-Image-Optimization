                    <h4>Apple</h4>
                    <p>An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are
                        cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree
                        originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today.
                        Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North
                        America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many
                        cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.</p>
